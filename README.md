# CalamanCy [WIP]

**CalamanCy** is a Tagalog natural language preprocessing framework made with [spaCy](https://spacy.io).
Its goal is to provide silver-standard pipelines and datasets for downstream NLP
tasks. This repository contains material for using CalamanCy, reproduction of
results, and guides on usage. 

> CalamanCy takes inspiration from other language-specific [spaCy Universe frameworks](https://spacy.io/universe) such as 
> [DaCy](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/DaCy), [huSpaCy](https://github.com/huspacy/huspacy),
> and [graCy](https://github.com/jmyerston/graCy). The name is based from [*calamansi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamansi),
> a citrus fruit native to the Philippines and used in traditional Filipino cuisine.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

To get started with CalamanCy, simply install it using `pip` by running the
following line in your terminal:

```sh
pip install calamancy
``` 


## ðŸ“¦ Models and Datasets

CalamanCy provides Tagalog models and datasets that you can use in your spaCy
pipelines.  As a low-resource language, most of these are based on
**silver-standard** data. You can check the `training/` and `datasets/`
directories to verify and reproduce these outputs (each folder is an instance of
a [spaCy project](https://spacy.io/usage/projects)).
