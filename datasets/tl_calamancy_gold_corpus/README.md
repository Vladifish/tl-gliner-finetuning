# ü™ê spaCy Project: Benchmarking gold-annotated TLUnified data

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `preprocess` | Preprocess the raw annotated data and convert into spaCy format. |
| `pretrain` | Pretrain with information from raw text |
| `build-floret` | Build floret binary for training fastText and floret vectors. |
| `train-vectors` | Train word vectors using the floret binary. |
| `init-vectors` | Initialize word vectors. |
| `train-ner` | Train the NER model. Usually called within the `benchmark.py` script. |
| `evaluate-ner` | Evaluate NER model. Usually called within the `benchmark.py` script. |
| `summarize-results` | Summarize results for a given experimental run. |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `ner` | `train-ner` &rarr; `evaluate-ner` |
| `vectors` | `build-floret` &rarr; `train-vectors` &rarr; `init-vectors` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets/tl_tlunified_gold_v1.0.jsonl` | URL | Annotated TLUnified dataset. |
| `assets/tlunified.zip` | URL | TLUnified dataset (from Improving Large-scale Language Models and Resources for Filipino by Cruz and Cheng 2022). |
| `assets/fasttext.tl.gz` | URL | Tagalog fastText vectors provided from the fastText website (trained from CommonCrawl and Wikipedia). |
| `assets/tlunified_raw_text.jsonl` | URL | Pre-converted raw text from TLUnified in JSONL format (1.1 GB). |
| `assets/tl_tlunified_pt_chars.bin` | URL | Pretraining weights for Tagalog using spaCy's pretrain command (using 'characters' objective). |
| `assets/floret` | Git | Floret repository for training floret and fastText models. |
