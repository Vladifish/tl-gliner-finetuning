# ü™ê spaCy Project: Creating a silver-standard dataset from the TLUnified Tagalog corpus

This project creates, `tl_calamancy_silver_corpus` a silver-standard dataset for
named-entity recognition (NER). It uses another silver-annotated
[WikiANN](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikiann) (`wikiann`) dataset to train an
initial NER model, and then bootstrapped the annotations of a larger
[TLUnified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06053) corpus (`tlunified`).

For evaluation, I trained two NER models, one from the original WikiANN corpus
(`tl_wikiann_silver`) and another from the TLUnified corpus
(`tl_tlunified_silver`). I then tested them against a small sample of
tlunified's data annotated by me, a native speaker, using
[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy).

The eventual goal of this project is to produce a gold-standard NER dataset
from TLUnified. This should help train more robust and performance Tagalog models
for structured prediction.


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `download-wikiann` | Download the WikiANN dataset from HuggingFace and save to spaCy format |
| `process-tlunified` | Convert the TLUnified dataset to the spaCy format |
| `train-wikiann` | Train a Tagalog NER model from the WikiANN dataset |
| `annotate-silver` | Annotate a larger TLUnified dataset using the trained model from WikiANN |
| `train-tlunified` | Train a Tagalog NER model from the tlunified dataset |
| `evaluate-wikiann` | Evaluate WikiANN to its test set |
| `evaluate-tlunified` | Evaluate TLUnified to its test set |
| `cross-evaluate-wikiann` | Evaluate the trained models to the silver-annotated WikiANN test set |
| `cross-evaluate-tlunified` | Evaluate the trained models to the silver-annotated tlunified test set |
| `cross-evaluate-gold` | Evaluate the trained models on an annotated subset of tlunified |
| `package` | Package the trained models from the silver-annotated datasets |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `download-wikiann` &rarr; `process-tlunified` &rarr; `train-wikiann` &rarr; `annotate-silver` &rarr; `train-tlunified` &rarr; `cross-evaluate-wikiann` &rarr; `cross-evaluate-tlunified` &rarr; `package` |
| `wikiann` | `download-wikiann` &rarr; `train-wikiann` &rarr; `evaluate-wikiann` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets/tlunified.zip` | URL | TLUnified dataset (from Improving Large-scale Language Models and Resources for Filipino by Cruz and Cheng 2022) |
